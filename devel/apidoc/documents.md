# Documents

These endpoints query documents associated with HotCRP submissions, reviews,
and comments. The `/upload` endpoint can be used to upload a large file using
multiple requests; this file can be a document or a temporary file intended
for input to another API.


# get /document

> Fetch document

Fetch a document and return it in the response body. Specify the document to
return either with the `doc` parameter, which names the document using a pattern
like `testconf-paper1.pdf`, or the `p`, `dt`, and optionally `attachment`
parameters, which define the submission ID, submission field, and attachment
name.

The `hash` and `docid` parameters let administrators and authors select a
specific version of a document. `hash` selects a document by hash, and `docid`
by internal document ID. Responses to requests with `hash` or `docid` are
usually cacheable.

Successful requests (HTTP status code 200) return the requested document as the
response, without any JSON wrapper. Find the document’s MIME type using the
response’s `Content-Type` header. Unsuccessful requests (HTTP status code 300 or
higher) usually return a JSON object with `ok` set to `false` and a
`message_list` describing the error.

This API understands conditional requests with HTTP headers `If-Match`,
`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`, and `If-Unmodified-Since`, and many
responses include `ETag` and `Last-Modified` HTTP headers. It also understands
range requests.


# get /documenthistory

> Fetch document history

Fetch information about all versions of a document accessible to the requesting
user. Use the `doc` parameter to specify a document by name, or `p` and `dt` to
specify it by type.

* response dt document_type
* response document_history [document_history_entry]


# get /formatcheck

> Check PDF format

Run HotCRP’s PDF format checker on a specified document. A human-readable
response is returned in `message_list`. The `problem_fields` response property
lists the names of any PDF checks that failed; examples include `"papersize"`,
`"pagelimit"`, `"columns"`, `"textblock"`, `"bodyfontsize"`, `"bodylineheight"`,
and `"wordlimit"`.

* param ?doc document_name
* param ?p
* param ?dt document_type
* param ?docid document_id
* param ?soft boolean
* response docid document_id
* response npages nullable_int: Number of pages in PDF
* response nwords nullable_int: Number of words in PDF
* response problem_fields [string]
* response has_error boolean


# get /archivelisting

> Fetch contents of archive document

Fetch the contents of a ZIP, .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or .tar.xz archive. The
contents are returned as a list of string filenames. The `consolidated=1`
parameter requests an additional `consolidated_listing`, which returns a
preformatted string that uses `{}` notation to represent subdirectories; for
instance, `subdir/{file1.txt, file2.txt}`.

* param ?consolidated boolean: True requests a `consolidated_listing`
* response listing [string]: List of archive elements
* response consolidated_listing string: Parsed contents of archive


# post /upload

> Upload file

Upload large files to HotCRP for later use.

Servers limit how much data they will accept in a single request. The upload
API uploads larger files over multiple requests. When an upload is complete,
later requests can refer to that file using an *upload token*.

The lifecycle of an upload is as follows.

1. A request with `start=1` begins a new upload. This request should also
   include a `size` parameter to define the size of the uploaded file, if that
   is known.
2. The response to this request will include the upload token for the uploaded
   file in its `token` field. This is a string like `hcupwhvGDVmHNYyDKdqeqA`.
   All subsequent requests relating to the upload must include this token as a
   `token` parameter.
3. Subsequent requests upload the contents of the file in chunks. The `blob`
   parameter (which can be an attached file) contains the chunk itself; the
   `offset` parameter defines the offset of chunk relative to the file.
4. A request with `finish=1` completes the upload. The server seals the upload
   and responds with the file’s content hash. A `finish=1` request will fail
   unless all expected chunks have been received.

`start=1` and `finish=1` requests can also include a chunk. The `ranges`
response field represents the ranges of bytes received so far.

The upload API is only available on sites that have enabled the document
store.

* param ?start boolean
* param ?finish boolean
* param ?cancel boolean
* param ?token upload_token
* param ?offset nonnegative_integer: Offset of `blob` in uploaded file
* param ?length nonnegative_integer: Length of `blob` in bytes (must match
  actual length of `blob`)
* param blob
* param ?size nonnegative_integer: Size of uploaded file in bytes
* param ?dt document_type: (start only) Purpose of uploaded document;
  typically corresponds to a submission field ID
* param ?temp boolean: (start only) If true, the uploaded file is
  expected to be temporary
* param ?mimetype mimetype: (start only) Type of uploaded file
* param ?filename string: (start only) Name of uploaded file
* response token upload_token
* response dt document_type
* response filename string
* response mimetype mimetype
* response size nonnegative_integer
* response ranges [offset_range]
* response hash string
* response crc32 string
* response progress_value integer
* response progress_max integer

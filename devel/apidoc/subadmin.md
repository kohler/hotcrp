# Submission administration

These endpoints set per-submission administrative assignments—the **decision**,
the discussion **lead**, the **shepherd**, and the submission **manager**—one
submission at a time, and move a review between rounds. They
exist for the HotCRP web application’s convenience; each is a thin wrapper around
the [assignment](#post-assign) machinery, so external integrations changing many
submissions should prefer the general-purpose [`/assign`](#post-assign) endpoint.

The four assignment roles:

* **Decision**—the submission’s accept/reject outcome.
* **Lead**—the PC member who leads discussion of the submission.
* **Shepherd**—the PC member who oversees the submission toward its final
  version.
* **Manager**—a specific user responsible for administering the submission.

Each role has a matching `GET` (read the current value) and `POST` (change it).
The `POST` endpoints require the appropriate administrative permission and report
the updated value in the same shape as the corresponding `GET`. The `GET`
endpoints are more widely readable: PC members and reviewers who may see the
value can call them, subject to the conference’s visibility settings.

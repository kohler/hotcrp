<p>All HotCRP paper lists are obtained through search, search syntax is flexible,
and it’s possible to download all matching papers and/or reviews at once.</p>

<li><div style='display:inline-block'>" . _searchForm("12") . "</div>&nbsp; finds paper #12.  When entered from a
 <a href='#quicklinks'>quicksearch</a> box, this search will jump to
 paper #12 directly.</li>
<li><a href='" . hoturl("help", "t=keywords") . "'>Search keywords</a>
 let you search specific fields, review scores, and more.</li>
<li>Use <a href='#quicklinks'>quicklinks</a> on paper pages to navigate
 through search results. Typing <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> also goes
 from paper to paper.</li>
<li>On search results pages, shift-click checkboxes to
 select paper ranges.</li>
</ul>");

    _subhead("How to search", "
<p>The default search box returns papers that match
<em>all</em> of the space-separated terms you enter.
To search for words that <em>start</em> with
a prefix, try “term*”.
To search for papers that match <em>some</em> of the terms,
type “term1 OR term2”.
To search for papers that <em>don’t</em> match a term,
try “-term”.  Or select
<a href='" . hoturl("search", "opt=1") . "'>Advanced search</a>
and use “With <b>any</b> of the words” and “<b>Without</b> the words.”</p>

<p>You can search in several paper classes, depending on your role in the
conference. Options include:</p>
<ul class='compact'>
<li><b>Submitted papers</b> &mdash; all submitted papers.</li>
<li><b>All papers</b> &mdash; all papers, including withdrawn and other non-submitted papers.</li>
<li><b>Your submissions</b> &mdash; papers for which you’re a contact.</li>
<li><b>Your reviews</b> &mdash; papers you’ve been assigned to review.</li>
<li><b>Your incomplete reviews</b> &mdash; papers you’ve been assigned to review, but haven’t submitted a review yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Search won’t show you information you aren’t supposed to see.  For example,
authors can only search their own submissions, and if the conference used
anonymous submission, then only the PC chairs can search by author.</p>

<p>By default, search examines paper titles, abstracts, and authors.
<a href='" . hoturl("search", "opt=1") . "'>Advanced search</a>
can search other fields, including authors/collaborators and reviewers.
Also, <b>keywords</b> search specific characteristics such as titles,
authors, reviewer names, and numbers of reviewers.  For example,
“ti:foo” means “search for ‘foo’ in paper
titles.”  Keywords are listed in the
<a href='" . hoturl("help", "t=keywords") . "'>search keywords reference</a>.</p>");

    _subhead("Search results", "
<p>Click on a paper number or title to jump to that paper.
Search matches are <span class='match'>highlighted</span> on paper screens.
Once on a paper screen use <a href='#quicklinks'>quicklinks</a>
to navigate through the rest of the search matches.</p>

<p>Underneath the paper list is the action area:</p>

" . Ht::img("exsearchaction.png", "[Search action area]") . "<br />

<p>Use the checkboxes to select some papers, then choose an action.
You can:</p>

<ul class='compact'>
<li>Download a <code>.zip</code> file with the selected papers.</li>
<li>Download all reviews for the selected papers.</li>
<li>Download tab-separated text files with authors, PC
 conflicts, review scores, and so forth (some options chairs only).</li>
<li>Add, remove, and define <a href='" . hoturl("help", "t=tags") . "'>tags</a>.</li>
<li>Assign reviewers and mark conflicts (chairs only).</li>
<li>Set decisions (chairs only).</li>
<li>Send mail to paper authors or reviewers (chairs only).</li>
</ul>

<p>Select papers one by one, select in groups by shift-clicking
the checkboxes, or use the “select all” link.
The easiest way to tag a set of papers is
to enter their numbers in the search box, search, “select all,” and add the
tag.</p>");

<ul>

<li><strong>Skip low-ranked submissions at the PC meeting.</strong> Mark
low-ranked submissions with tag “#nodiscuss”, then ask the PC to " .
_searchLink("#nodiscuss", "search for “#nodiscuss”") . " (“" .
_searchLink("tag:nodiscuss") . "” also works). PC members can check the list
for papers they’d like to discuss anyway. They can email the chairs about
such papers, or, even easier, add a “#discussanyway” tag. (You might make the
“#nodiscuss” tag chair-only so an evil PC member couldn’t add it to a
high-ranked paper, but it’s usually better to trust the PC.)</li>

<li><strong>Mark controversial papers that would benefit from additional review.</strong>
 PC members could add the “#controversy” tag when the current reviewers disagree.
 A <a href='" . hoturl("search", "q=%23controversy") . "'>search</a> shows where the PC thinks more review is needed.</li>

<li><strong>Mark PC-authored papers for extra scrutiny.</strong>
 First, <a href='" . hoturl("search", "t=s&amp;qt=au") . "'>search for PC members’ last names in author fields</a>.
 Check for accidental matches and select the papers with PC members as authors, then use the action area below the search list to add the tag “#pcpaper”.
 A <a href='" . hoturl("search", "t=s&amp;qx=%23pcpaper") . "'>search</a> shows papers without PC authors.
 (Since PC members can see whether a paper is tagged “#pcpaper”, you may want to delay defining the tag until just before the meeting.)</li>

<li><strong>Vote for papers.</strong>
 The chair can define special allotment voting tags$votetags$setting.
 Each PC member is assigned an allotment of votes to distribute among papers.
 For instance, if “#{$votetag1}” were a voting tag with an allotment of 10, then a PC member could assign 5 votes to a paper by adding the twiddle tag “#~{$votetag1}#5”.
 The system automatically sums PC members’ votes into the public “#{$votetag1}” tag.
 To search for papers by vote count, search for “<a href='" . hoturl("search", "t=s&amp;q=rorder:$votetag1") . "'>rorder:{$votetag1}</a>”. (<a href='" . hoturl("help", "t=votetags") . "'>Learn more</a>)</li>

<li><strong>Rank papers.</strong>
 Each PC member can set tags indicating their preference ranking for papers.
 For instance, a PC member’s favorite paper would get tag “#~rank#1”, the next favorite “#~rank#2”, and so forth.
 The chair can then combine these rankings into a global preference order using a Condorcet method.
 (<a href='" . hoturl("help", "t=ranking") . "'>Learn more</a>)</li>

<li><strong>Define a discussion order for the PC meeting.</strong>
 Publishing the order lets PC members prepare to discuss upcoming papers.
 Define an ordered tag such as “#discuss”, then ask the PC to <a href='" . hoturl("search", "q=order:discuss") . "'>search for “order:discuss”</a>.
 The PC can now see the order and use quick links to go from paper to paper.$conflictmsg2</li>

<li><strong>Mark tentative decisions during the PC meeting</strong> either
 using decision selectors or, perhaps, “#accept” and
 “#reject” tags.</li>

algorithm, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method'>the Schulze
method</a> by default, combines these rankings into a global preference order.</p>

<p>HotCRP supports ranking through <a
href='" . hoturl("help", "t=tags") . "'>tags</a>.  The chair chooses
a tag for ranking—“rank” is a good default—and enters it on <a
href='" . hoturl("settings", "group=tags") . "'>the settings page</a>.
PC members then rank papers using their private versions of this tag,
tagging their first preference with “~rank#1”,
their second preference with “~rank#2”,
and so forth.  To combine PC rankings into a global preference order, the PC
chair selects all papers on the <a href='" . hoturl("search", "q=") . "'>search page</a>
and chooses Tags &gt; Calculate&nbsp;rank, entering
“rank” for the tag.  At that point, the global rank can be viewed
by a <a href='" . hoturl("search", "q=order:rank") . "'>search for
“order:rank”</a>.</p>

<p>PC members can enter rankings by reordering rows in a paper list.
For example, for rank tag “rank”, PC members should
<a href=\"" . hoturl("search", "q=editsort%3A%23~rank") . "\">search for “editsort:#~rank”</a>.
Ranks can be entered directly in the text fields, or the rows can be dragged
into position using the dotted areas on the right-hand side of the list.</p>

<p>Alternately, PC members can use an <a href='" . hoturl("offline") . "'>offline
ranking form</a>. Download a ranking file, rearrange the lines to create a
rank, and upload the form again.  For example, here is an initial ranking
file:</p>

<pre class='entryexample'>
# Edit the rank order by rearranging this file's lines.
# The first line has the highest rank.

# Lines that start with \"#\" are ignored.  Unranked papers appear at the end
# in lines starting with \"X\", sorted by overall merit.  Create a rank by
# removing the \"X\"s and rearranging the lines.  A line that starts with \"=\"
# marks a paper with the same rank as the preceding paper.  A line that starts
# with \">>\", \">>>\", and so forth indicates a rank gap between the preceding
# paper and the current paper.  When you are done, upload the file at
#   http://your.site.here.com/offline

<p>Program committee members and administrators can search and display <em>formulas</em>
that calculate properties of paper scores&mdash;for instance, the
standard deviation of papers’ Overall merit scores, or average Overall
merit among reviewers with high Reviewer expertise.</p>

<p>To display a formula, use a search term such as “<a href=\""
             . hoturl("search", "q=show%3avar%28OveMer%29") . "\">show:var(OveMer)</a>” (show
the variance in Overall merit scores).
Add “<a href=\"" . hoturl("search", "q=show%3avar%28OveMer%29+show%3astatistics") . "\">show:statistics</a>” to show summary statistics over all papers,
and <a href=\"" . hoturl("graph", "g=formula") . "\">graph formulas</a>.
To search for a formula, use a search term such as “<a href=\""
             . hoturl("search", "q=formula%3avar%28OveMer%29%3e0.5") . "\">formula:var(OveMer)>0.5</a>”
(select papers with variance in Overall merit greater than 0.5).
Or save formulas using <a
href=\"" . hoturl("search", "q=&amp;tab=formulas") . "\">Search &gt; Display options
&gt; Edit formulas</a>.</p>

<p>Formulas use a familiar expression language.
For example, this computes the sum of the squares of the overall merit scores:</p>

<blockquote>sum(OveMer*OveMer)</blockquote>

This calculates an average of overall merit scores, weighted by expertise
(high-expertise reviews are given slightly more weight):</p>

<blockquote>wavg(OveMer, RevExp >= 4 ? 1 : 0.8)</blockquote>

<p>And there are many variations. This version gives more weight to PC
reviewers with the “#heavy” tag:</p>

<blockquote>wavg(OveMer, re:#heavy + 1)</blockquote>

<p>(“re:#heavy + 1” equals 2 for #heavy reviews and 1 for others.)</p>

<p>Formulas work better for numeric scores, but you can use them for letter
scores too. HotCRP uses alphabetical order for letter scores, so the “min” of
scores A, B, and D is A. For instance:</p>

<blockquote>count(confidence=X)</blockquote>");

  that authors “freeze” each submission explicitly; only
  administrators can update frozen submissions.
  The only deadline that really matters is the paper submission
  deadline, but HotCRP also supports a separate paper registration deadline,
  which will force authors to register a few days before they submit.  An
  optional <em>grace period</em> applies to both deadlines:
  HotCRP reports the deadlines, but allows submissions and updates post-deadline

    _subhead("Chair conflicts", "
<p>Chairs and system administrators can access any information stored in the
conference system, including reviewer identities for conflicted papers.
It is easiest to simply accept such conflicts as a fact of life. Chairs
who can’t handle conflicts fairly shouldn’t be chairs. However, HotCRP
does offer other mechanisms for conflicted reviews.</p>

<p>The key step is to pick a PC member to manage the reviewing and
discussion process for the relevant papers. This PC member is called the
<em>paper administrator</em>. Use the left-hand side of the
<a href='" . hoturl("assign") . "'>paper assignment pages</a> to enter paper administrators. (You may need to
“Override conflicts” to access the assignment page.)
A paper’s administrators have full privilege to assign and view reviews
for that paper, although they cannot change conference settings.</p>

<p>Assigned administrators change conflicted chairs’
access rights. Normally, a conflicted chair can easily override
their conflict. If a paper has an administrator, however, conflicts cannot
be overridden until the administrator is removed.</p>

<p>Paper administrators make life easy for PC reviewers while hiding
conflicts from chairs in most circumstances.
However, determined chairs can still discover reviewer identities
via HotCRP logs, review counts, and mails (and, of course,
by removing the administrator).
For additional privacy, a conference can use
<em>review tokens</em>, which are completely anonymous
review slots. To create a token, an administrator
goes to an <a href='" . hoturl("assign") . "'>assignment page</a>
and clicks on “Request review” without entering a name
or email address. This reports the token, a short string of letters and
numbers such as “9HDZYUB”. Any user who knows the token can
enter it on HotCRP’s home page, after which the system lets them
view the paper and anonymously modify the corresponding “Jane Q. Public”
review. True reviewer identities will not appear in HotCRP’s
database or its logs.
For even more privacy, the paper administrator could collect
offline review forms via email and upload them using
review tokens; then even web server access logs store only the
administrator’s identity.</p>");

  href='" . hoturl("search", "q=dec:yes&amp;t=s") . "'>download
  all final versions as a <code>.zip</code> archive</a>.  (The submitted
  versions are archived for reference.)</p></li>

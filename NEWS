Version 2.24   22.Aug.2008

* Major changes

** New paper display.  Paper, review, and comment views are unified into a
   single display format.  The paper view shows initial words of abstract
   and compressed author list; both are easily unfoldable.  Tags,
   discussion leads, shepherds, review preferences, PC conflicts, and other
   PC-type information appear in a strip down the left hand side.  Paper
   views summarize comment counts and comment authorship.  I think this is
   a huge improvement.

** Voting tags.  Chairs can define tags used for voting, with vote
   allotments, as in "vote#20".  PC members vote for papers by assigning
   the corresponding twiddle tag, as in "~vote#1".  The system prevents
   users from going over their allotments, and automagically maintains a
   public "vote" tag that sums users' votes.

** Ranking tag.  Preliminary support for paper rankings via the tags system.

** Review ratings are searchable and gain more options.  The current set of
   ratings is "Average, Very helpful, Not complete, Not convincing, Not
   constructive, Not correct."  (Is this too many?)  The home page reports
   a user's rated reviews.  Searching for "rate:+" finds positively rated
   reviews, "rate:-" negatively rated reviews, and e.g. "rate:convincing"
   finds "not convincing" rated reviews.  Robbert van Renesse feedback was
   very helpful.

* New features and new behavior

** New search syntax: Support partial word matches, as in "foo*" or
   "bl*ah".  Search for a tag in reverse order with "rorder:tag".  Search
   within tag orders with, for instance, "tag:pcrating#2" or
   "tag:pcrating#>2" (Rich Draves request).  Search for incomplete reviews
   with "ire:whatever" (Rich Draves request).  Chairs and administrators
   can search other users' twiddle tags, as in "tag:frank~vote".

** Ordered tags: The "define ordered" and "add ordered" tag actions skip
   order steps; for example, they might assign order 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10.
   This hides information from conflicted PC members, since they can no
   longer infer conflicted papers' positions by looking for gaps.  New
   "Define sequential" and "Add sequential" actions do the old sequential
   style.

** Search highlight improvements: Searching only highlights terms in the
   relevant fields; for example, "au:john" won't highlight "john" in the
   title.  Also automagically unfold any field that contains a highlight.

** Offline reviewing improvements.  Blank review forms ignored on upload,
   rather than causing warnings (Rebecca Isaacs request).  Supposedly
   "ready" review forms that lack required fields are saved anyway, they're
   just not marked as "ready" (Rebecca Isaacs request).  The system detects
   and rejects attempts to upload an offline form after a review is edited
   online (Fred Douglis report).  Clarify where numeric scores are entered
   (Benjamin Pierce request).

** Paper assignment UI improvements.  Reorder fields, make submission
   behavior clearer.  Automatic assignment: can shift-click on PC member
   ranges.  Show topic interest scores and preferences as "Txxx Pyyy".
   Automatic assignment can clear existing assignments.  Bug fixes.
   (Benjamin Pierce and Jeff Mogul requests)

** Comment visibility changes.  Users can mark a comment as "tied to
   reviews," which means that PC members who haven't read the reviews can't
   see the comment either.  This is more useful, arguably, than hiding
   comments from external reviewers.  (Robbert van Renesse request)

** A tweak to Minshall score improves its behavior when papers have
   different numbers of reviews (Terence Kelly report).

** External reviewers can use review tokens, since owning a review token
   confers the right to view the corresponding paper.

* Bug fixes and minor UI improvements

** The "Reviewers can see decisions" setting also applies to the PC.

** "Merge accounts" bug fixes.

** PC members always count as reviewers, even if they haven't had any
   reviews assigned yet (Laurel Krieger report).

** Paper lists never show conflicted PC members counts of reviews
   (Fred Douglis report).

** Mail tool: Include %COMMENTS% in mails even when sending mail before
   reviews are visible in the site.  This is the same as the %REVIEWS%
   behavior.  (Jeff Mogul report)  Also, issue a warning about sending mail
   with %REVIEWS% or %COMMENTS% when reviews aren't visible on the site.

** Mail tool: If authors can see reviews only after finishing their own,
   then the mail tool will hide reviews and comments from authors who have
   not finished their own reviews.  And include a warning.

** Mail tool: JavaScript discourages users from clicking on the "Send"
   button too early (Robbert van Renesse, Rich Draves report).

** Mail tool: Report how many emails remain to be sent.

** Mail tool: Add "Discussion leads" and "Shepherds" recipient types (Jeff
   Mogul request).

** Mail tool: The action log tracks sent mail (Jeff Mogul request).

** "Refuse review" reason field is bigger (Benjamin Pierce report).

** Search bug fix: "order:~privatetag" works (Rich Draves report).

** Search: Add Download > Discussion leads and Download > Shepherds (Jeff
   Mogul request).

** Search: Add Display options > Row numbers (Rich Draves request).

** Search: Tag order searches gain an explicit search column heading so that
   the sort order can be reversed.  Request and UI ideas from Rich Draves.

** Settings: Validate XHTML, preventing cross-site scripting bugs.

* Special thanks to Robbert van Renesse.


Version 2.23   22.Jul.2008

* Do not infinite loop when sending mail to non-ASCII names associated with
  long email addresses.  Reported by Robbert van Renesse and Rich Draves.

* Report correct number of reviews on the program committee page, even if
  review ratings are enabled.  Reported by Robbert van Renesse.

* Correct PHP warnings and make compatible with older PHPs.  Reported by
  Jeonghee Shin.


Version 2.22   15.Jul.2008

* Appearance fixes: use default controls in most cases.

* Aggregated information about review ratings are provided on the PC
  details page.

* Allow searches of review fields and scores.  For example, "ove-mer:2>=2"
  searches for papers that have at least 2 overall merit scores that are
  greater than or equal to 2.  Requested by Rich Draves and Robbert van
  Renesse.

* Support multiple-choice paper options (rather than checkbox).  Requested
  by Jeff Mogul.

* Improve some messages and help text.


Version 2.21   11.May.2008

* Further improve validation and Internet Explorer 6 compatibility.


Version 2.20   11.May.2008

* Improve Internet Explorer 6 compatibility.  Reported by Terence Kelly.
  Includes Drew McLellan's supersleight for transparent PNG support
  (http://24ways.org/2007/supersleight-transparent-png-in-ie6).

* Some validation fixes.

* Set MySQL's max_allowed_packet on a per-session basis based on PHP's
  upload_max_filesize, rather than relying on users to set
  max_allowed_packet correctly.  A problem was reported by Sourabh Jain.

* Bug fixes to preference list, English, and createdb script.


Version 2.19   6.May.2008

* Provide visible feedback on Ajax forms.

* Improve manual assignments page with better conflict listings (Rebecca
  Isaacs).


Version 2.18   5.May.2008

* Record PC feedback about whether reviews were helpful.  PC members and,
  optionally, external reviewers can rate one another's reviews.  Hopefully
  this will help improve the quality of reviews.  "Was this review helpful
  for you?" appears above each visible review.  HotCRP reports the number
  of ratings for each review and how many of those ratings were
  positive. It does not report who gave the ratings, and it never shows
  rating counts to authors.

* The $Opt["emailSender"] option lets you set the envelope sender in sent
  mail (Robbert van Renesse).

* Add review tokens, which allow reviewers to edit reviews anonymously.

* Prettier styles.

* Bug fix: Correct commenter identities in comment emails.

* Finish (?) information exposure fixes (David Andersen).

* Banal works with pdftohtml 0.36 (Robbert van Renesse).

* When a paper is withdrawn, its reviewers no longer need to complete their
  reviews (Stefan Savage).


Version 2.17   23.Apr.2008

* IMPORTANT: Continue reviewer identity leak fix via search rewrite.

* Rewrite search again.  Search now works like Google search.  "-word"
  excludes "word" matches from the search.  "word1 OR word2" searches for
  either "word1" or "word2" (the OR must be uppercase).  The default search
  box returns papers that match ALL the words.  Searches in title,
  abstract, and authors match whole words, not portions of words.  The
  process of building up and executing a query is cleaner and comes closer
  to the ideal of returning all visible information.

* Paper lists report "0" reviews for papers that never got a review (rather
  than "0/1").


Version 2.16   21.Apr.2008

* IMPORTANT: Reviewer identity leak fix.

* Improve usability with tooltips and appearance improvements (inspired by
  John Wilkes).


Version 2.15   9.Apr.2008

* Improve homepage with a right-hand sidebar.

* PC members can download any PDF that is "ready for review," even if the
  submission period has not closed.  A warning informs them that authors
  can still update.

* Show SHA-1 checksums for paper submissions (Dave Andersen).

* Download: Review forms (zip) returns a .zip with a separate review form
  file for each form (Jeff Mogul).

* Display "Your discussion leads" link even before "PC can view all
  reviews" is set (Brad Beckmann).

* Bug fix: Fix manual chair assignment page (Mark Gebhart).

* Bug fix: Fix review form download from the review page (Mark Gebhart).

* Bug fix: Do not reveal author names to reviewers when authors withdraw a
  paper already under review (Stefan Savage).

* Bug fix: "Reviewers" user search returns reviewers that completed reviews
  for papers that have since been withdrawn.

* Bug fix: Authors can see review form guidance.

* Bug fix: Searching for "cre:>0", etc. works.

  documentation improvements.

* Thanks to Michael Vrable, Stefan Savage, and Scott Rose.


Version 2.13   22.Jan.2008

* Add support for paper format checking with Geoff Voelker's banal script.
  Thanks to Geoff for the script and debugging support, and to Harald
  Schiöberg for providing an initial implementation.

  "paperId=" with "p=", "reviewId=" with "r=", "commentId=" with "c=".

* Bug fixes and memory reduction fixes.  Especially speed up first-time
  loads by reporting the correct Content-Length for gzipped content
  (problem reported by Elliott Karpilovsky).

* Thanks also to Matthew Frank, Joseph Tucek, and Bernhard Ager.


Version 2.12   30.Dec.2007

  PC members that created them.  Based on a request from Matthew Frank.

* Add an optional note to the reviewer that PC members can supply with

  selected papers.

* UI fixes for conflict of interest wording and home page (thanks, Matthew
  Frank), autoassignment page, search help, search page.

Version 2.7   23.Aug.2007

* Email notification for comments.  Authors, reviewers, and PC members can
  request email notification when comments are added to a paper they are
  interested in.  The system tracks a global preference and per-paper
  preferences, so one can say "no notifications in general, but notify me
  about paper 4".  Notification is on by default.  Requires schema changes;
  see the file 'Code/updateschema.sql'.

* PC members and reviewers can view a paper's comments before they finish
  their own reviews for that paper.

* Reviews have a "The review is ready for others to see." checkbox, instead
  of "Submit" vs. "Save changes" pushbuttons.  The checkbox is a better UI.

  email is listed in the Email field of a paper's author information, that
  user becomes a contact author for the paper and can edit the paper.

* XHTML 1.0 Strict conformance.

* Performance improvements: better cacheability for images, gzip JavaScript
  and CSS.

Reporting security issues
=========================

HotCRP takes security seriously. We appreciate researchers who disclose
security issues responsibly, and appropriately acknowledge researchers who
report security bugs.

To report a security issue in HotCRP, or in the [HotCRP.com
service](https://hotcrp.com), you may email the HotCRP maintainer at
`ekohler@gmail.com`, or [report a security advisory on
GitHub](https://github.com/kohler/hotcrp/security/advisories/new).

We will send a response to indicate next steps and keep you informed as you
develop a fix.

How to test
-----------

Researchers are welcome to deploy and test open-source HotCRP on their own
infrastructure. Researchers may also probe test sites they create via
[test.hotcrp.com](https://test.hotcrp.com). Researchers may not attack or
probe other [HotCRP.com](https://hotcrp.com) sites unless they obtain prior
authorization from the HotCRP.com maintainer. Inappropriate information
extraction from or modification of HotCRP.com sites may lead to account
suspension or termination, and to further consequences, including escalation
to ACM, IEEE, and other appropriate ethics boards. A user who discovers an
apparent security bug on a HotCRP.com site must promptly report the issue and
not share information about the bug with others.
